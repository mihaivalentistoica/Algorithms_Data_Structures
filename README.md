# Algorithms and Data Structures

During this module you will learn what an algorithm is and what are the 
differences between various implementations of the same solution. You will
also get to know various data structures and their sample implementations.

Some of the topics covered:
- What is an algorithm?
- Computational complexity and "Big O" notation
- Sample sorting algorithms
- Data structures: stack, queue, linked list, tree __*__
